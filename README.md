# We-Talk-Alot

<br>
lets do something fun in our meetings ``` Rules are simple ```
<br>
1. each bunch of members see their given task
2. each bunch will commit their work according to the given task in each .md file
3. individual commits to edit the .md files will not be counted
4. a mohsen shall be given to each team member on each commit made
5. minimum 10 mohsens per team to get the mega package (5 extra mohsens)
6. branching and merging to the main repo will make the team gain extra 5 mohsens
